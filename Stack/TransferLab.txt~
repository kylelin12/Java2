1. Write the ArrayStack method transferTo(ArrayStack<E> rhs) that transfers
   the elements from the stack to rhs until either the stack is empty
   or rhs is full.

  public void transferTo(ArrayStack<E> rhs){
  	 < your code goes here>     
  }

2. Assume there are 3 array stacks, A, B and C. 
   A has a capacity of 100 and is full.
   B has a capacity of 5 and is empty.
   C has a capacity of 3 and is also empty.

   Using only the transferTo method, how would you get 4 elements into 
   Stack B.



3. Implement the stack ADT using the Java ArrayList class. Name this
   class ArrayListStack<E>.
   
   Using only AP ArrayList methods in your solution.
