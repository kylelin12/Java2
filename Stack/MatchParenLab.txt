2. Stacks are often used to verify whether a given expression contains matching 
   (balanced) parentheses.

   In the MatchParen.java program, an expression is read and stored as a String, then
   the program verfies that all parentheses are balanced.

   Let the set of opening paretheses include only the Strings : (,[,and {.
   And the set of closinging paretheses are: ),],and }.

   Here are 4 examples of expressions with matching parentheses:
    a.  ()
    b. ( { [ ]} )
    c. {[ 2 + ( 4 * 8)]}

    d. public static void main(String [] args){ 
         int [] x = {1,2,3};
       }  


3. Complete the functions in MatchParen.java.
   However, when working with Strings, limit yourself to the AP String methods.
