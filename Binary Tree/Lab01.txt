Add the following methods to TreeApp.
=====================================

1. Write the method isLeaf() that returns true if the node is a leaf;
   false otherwise.

   public static<E> boolean isLeaf(TreeNode<E> rt) {}


2. Write the method countLeaves() that returns the number of leaves
   in a binary tree.

   public static<E> int countLeaves(TreeNode<E> rt) {}


3. Write the method height() that returns the height of a binary tree.
   
    public static<E> int height(TreeNode<E> rt) {}
    
4. Write the method insertBalanced() that inserts a new leaf into a binary 
   tree by placing the leaf into the left or right subtree with fewer nodes.
   The height of the tree should only increase if the tree was completely
   balanced.
   // post condition: inserts a leaf into the tree and returns the 
   //                 root of the tree.
   public static<E> TreeNode<E> insertBalanced(TreeNode<E> rt, E value)
