# Sets
#### Set
A **set** is a collection of objects.                
An object is either contained in the set or it is not.              
Therefore all the objects in this set are unique (no duplicates)            
\* A set may be ordered.              

A TreeSet is a set of ordered objects.                
The objects in a TreeSet must be comparable.
