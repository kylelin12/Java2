1. Download the files from Labs/SLinkedList and put each file
   in the same directory.

     - List.java
     - Node.java
     - SLinkedList.java
     - SLTester.java

2. Review the List interface.
    * Ap subclass is ArrayList
    
3.Implement A Singly Linked List class, SLinkedList is a subclass of List.
 
     - An SLinkedList has the same capabilities as an ArrayList, however
       it allocates memory dynamically at runtime and the runtime of its
       methods may differ.

     - Each Node object stores a String value and Node reference, _next,
       which refers to the next node in the list or null.

     - The class has 3 private attributes:
       Node
         _head refers to either null or the first Node in the list.
	 _tail refers to either null of the last Node in the list.

       int
        _size stores the current length of the list

4. Run the SLTester.java program.
   Ignore the compiler warning. We will fix it later.


5. From the List Interface, implement:

    boolean add(String val)

    This methods adds a val to the end of the list.


6. Test the code in SLTester.

7. What is the expected runtime of add(String)?

8. Implement the method:

    void add(int, String)

9. Test the code in SLTester.

10 . What is the expected runtime of add(int,String)?

11. Write the methods:

      String get(int)
      String set(int, String)

12. Test these methods and determine the expected runtime?

13. Implement the method:

      String remove(int).

14. Test these methods and determine the expected runtime?
