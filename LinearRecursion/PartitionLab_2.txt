Dutch National Flag Problem
===========================

Write a static method that sorts an integer array that is known to have
at most three different values. (Edsgar Dijkstra named this the Dutch-national-
flag problem because the result is three "stripes" of values like the three
stripes in the flag.). Hint: Reduce to the previous problem, by first
partitioning the array into two parts with all elements having the smallest
value in the first part and all other elements in the second part, then
partition the second part.
