;; Sedgewick and Wayne p.547

Write a static method that sorts an integer array that is known to have
at most two different values. Maintain two pointers, one starting at the
left end and moving right, the other starting at the right end and moving
left. Maintain the invariant that all elements to the left of the left
pointer are equal to the smaller of the two values and all elements to
the right of the right pointer are equal to the larger of the two values.




public static void partition(int [] data){
       int left = 0;
       int right = data.length - 1;
       int curr = left;
       int temp;
       while (left < right){
          if (data[curr] < data[left]){

	  }
	   

       }



}
