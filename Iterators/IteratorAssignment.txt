   Write a program that creates a list of consecutive integers from 0 to N.
   Have N be determined from the command line. Then compute the number
   of even integers in the list in the following 3 ways:
   


    - use a for-each loop
    - use an iterator directly
    - use the get(int) method

    Implement three versions of the following function:

     public static int countEvens(List<Integer> L){}



   Make sure to test your code with both an ArrayList and a LinkedList.


   You'll need to import the following classes:

   	  import java.util.ArrayList;
	  import java.util.LinkedList;
	  import java.util.List;
	  import java.util.Iterator;
